====================================
Solarus is an open-source Zelda-like game engine written in C++.
This engine is used by our Zelda fangames.
The git repository of Solarus includes two subprojects:

* Solarus: the C++ engine.
* Solarus Quest Editor: an editor for creating quests, written in Java.
    * Note: The quest editor needs Java 7.

Solarus and Solarus Quest Editor are both licensed under GPL v3.

You might be interested in our fangames created with Solarus:

* [Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX](https://github.com/christopho/zsdx), our main creation.

* [Zelda Mystery of Solarus XD](https://github.com/christopho/zsxd), a parodic game released on April 1st, 2011

See our [development blog](http://www.solarus-games.org) to get more
information and documentation about using the Solarus engine.
The compilation and installation instructions can be found
in the install.txt file or on our [website](http://www.solarus-games.org/source-code/compilation-instructions).
