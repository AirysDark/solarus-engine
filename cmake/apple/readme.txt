This is Solarus, the open-source A-RPG game engine.

This OSX package contains:
- solarus-run: The executable file of the engine. Run it with the path of
  your quest as argument (the directory containing data/ or data.solarus).
  Without this argument, the current directory is used as quest path.
  Try also 'solarus -help' to show information about the command-line
  options.
- A sample quest. This is a very minimalist example of game with only one map
  and almost nothing to do, but you can run it or edit it.
- Solarus (Solarus.app): A package you can use to distribute a quest on
  other OSX system with non-developer environment.
  It embed the solarus-run binary (Solarus.app/Contents/Resources/solarus-run), the
  sample quest (Solarus.app/Contents/Resources/data) and all needed dependencies.
  The bundle is made to run any data/ or data.solarus quest located into
  Solarus.app/Contents/Resources.
- Solarus Quest Editor: An editor that helps you create maps and tilesets
  for your quest.
  See http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/latest/ to know how to create a quest.
