Solarus is an open-source Zelda-like game engine written in C++.
This engine is used by our Zelda fangames.
Our git repository of Solarus includes two subprojects:
- Solarus: the C++ engine (under GPL),
- Solarus Quest Editor: an editor for creating quests, written in Java (still
  under development).
