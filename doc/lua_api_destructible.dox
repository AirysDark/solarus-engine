The ones that can be lifted may require a minimum level of
the \c "lift" \ref lua_api_game_get_ability "ability".

\section lua_api_destructible_inherited_methods Methods inherited from map entity

Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_destructible_methods Methods of the type destructible

None.

\section lua_api_destructible_inherited_events Events inherited from map entity

Events are callback methods automatically called by the engine if you define
them.

Destructible objects a reparticular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all events from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_events to know these events.

\section lua_api_destructible_events Events of the type destructible
