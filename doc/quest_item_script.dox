TODO

The properties of each equipment item is defined by a Lua script
(e.g. what happens when the item appears, what happens when the player
receives the items, etc.).
These Lua scripts are located in the \c items directory of your quest.

See the section \ref lua_api to know the Lua API provided by Solarus
to item scripts.
