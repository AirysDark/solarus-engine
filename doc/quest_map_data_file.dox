/**
\page quest_map_data_file Map definition file

\tableofcontents

The \c maps directory contains the full description and the script of each map.

Maps are areas where the game takes place.
They may be rooms, houses, entire dungeon floors, parts of the outside
world or any place.

A map with id \c xx is defined with two files:
- \c xx.dat: Definition of all entities of this map (tiles, enemies,
  non-playing characters, chests, teletransporters, etc.)
  and the properties of the map.
  This page will describe the syntax of this file.
- \c xx.lua: Lua script of the map. It defines the dynamic events that happen
  on your map at runtime, such as opening a door, making enemies appear,
  moving a non-playing character, etc.
  See the \ref lua_api_map "map API" page for more details about map scripts.

A map is composed of the following information:
- a size in pixels,
- a \ref quest_tileset_data_file "tileset"
  (the graphical skin used to draw its tiles),
- a background music,
- the world it belongs to (allows to define groups of maps),
- its location relative to its world,
- the floor it belongs to (if any),
- all entities of the map (tiles, enemies, chests, pots, switches, etc.).

All of this is stored in the map data file \c xx.dat.
We now specify its syntax below.

\section quest_map_data_file_syntax Syntax of the map data file

Solarus Quest Editor fully supports the edition of maps.
You should not have to edit map data files by hand unless you know what you
are doing.

The sequence of characters \c \-\- (two dashes) marks
the beginning of a comment.
After them, the rest of the line is ignored by the engine.
Empty lines are also ignored.

\subsection quest_map_data_file_syntax_properties Map properties

The first element in the map data file describes the properties of the map.
The definition of these properties starts with
\c properties{ and ends with \c }.
Properties are declared with the syntax <tt>key = value</tt> and
separated with commas. It is allowed to have an extra comma after
the last property. String values should be enclosed within
double quotes.
The following properties must be defined:
- \c width (number): Width of the map in pixels. Must be a multiple of 8.
- \c height (number): Height of the map in pixels. Must be a multiple of 8.
- \c world (string): A name that identifies a group of maps this map
  belongs to. Worlds allow to group maps together.
  The world can be any arbitrary name. Maps that have the same world name
  are considered to be part of the same environment.
  The starting location of the savegame is automatically set by the engine
  when the world changes (not when the map changes).
  See \ref lua_api_map_get_world "map:get_world()" for more details.
- \c x (number, optional): X coordinate of the top-left corner of the map in
  its world. Useful to store the location of this map if it belongs to a group
  of adjacent maps.
  The engine uses this information to implement scrolling between two adjacent
  maps. The default value is \c 0.
  See \ref lua_api_map_get_location "map:get_location()" for more
  details.
- \c y (number, optional): Y coordinate of the top-left corner of the map in
  it world. The default is \c 0.
- \c floor (number, optional): The floor of this map if it is part of a floor
  system.
  This property is optional.
  The engine does not do anything particular with the floor,
  but your quest can use it in scripts, for example to show the current floor
  on the HUD when it changes or to make a minimap menu.
  \c 0 is the first floor, \c 1
  is the second floor, \c -1 is the first basement floor, etc.
- \c tileset (string): Id of the \ref quest_tileset_data_file "tileset"
  to use as a skin for this map.
- \c music (string, optional): Id of the music to play when entering this map.
  It can be a music file name relative to the \c "musics" directory
  (without extension), or the special value \c "none" to play no music on
  this map, or the special value \c "same" to keep the music unchanged.
  No value means no music.

Example of map properties definition:
\verbatim
properties{
  width = 2048,
  height = 2048,
  world = "outside",
  x = 0,
  y = 0,
  tileset = "overworld",
  music = "village",
}
\endverbatim

\subsection quest_map_data_file_syntax_entities Declaration of map entities

The rest of the map data file declares all entities (tiles, enemies, chests,
etc.) initially present on the map when this map is loaded during the game.

\remark Recall that during the game, after this loading phase,
map entities can also be created or destroyed dynamically using the
\ref lua_api_map "Lua map scripting API".

There exists many types of entities and most of them can be declared in the
map data file. Here is their list
(if you want all types of map entities, including the ones that cannot be
declared in the map data file, see the
\ref lua_api_entity "map entity API"):

The definition of a map entity starts with \c entity_type{ and ends with
\c }, where \c entity_type is a type of entity (see below).
Inside the braces, the properties of the entity are specified.
Properties are declared with the syntax <tt>key = value</tt> and
separated with commas. It is allowed to have an extra comma after
the last property. String values should be enclosed within
double quotes.

\subsubsection quest_map_data_file_syntax_common Common properties

The following properties exist for all types of entities:
- \c name (string, optional): Name identifying the entity on the map.
  The name is optional: you will only need it if you need to refer to this
  entity individually, for example to make a
  \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_switch "switch" open a
  \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_door "door". 
  If you define a name to an entity, it must be unique in the map.
  All entities can have a name except
  \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_tile "tiles": this is because tiles
  don't exist individually at runtime for performance reasons.
- \c layer (number): Layer where the entity is at runtime:
  \c 0 (low layer), \c 1 (intermediate layer) or \c 2 (high layer).
- \c x (number): X coordinate of the entity relative to the upper-left corner
  of the map.
  The \ref lua_api_entity_get_origin "origin point" of the entity will be
  placed at these coordinates (for tiles, it is the upper-left corner).
- \c y (number): Y coordinate of the entity relative to the upper-left corner
  of the map.

\c name, \c x, \c y and \c layer are common to all types of entities
(except \c name for \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_tile "tiles").
We now detail the specific properties of each type of entity.

\subsubsection quest_map_data_file_syntax_tile Tile

Tiles are the small fixed bricks that compose the map.

The engine makes a special performance treatment for them.
For this reason, this map data file is the only place where they can be
declared: they can never be accessed or created at runtime.
If you want to access a tile at runtime (typically, to make it appear or
disappear), use a \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_dynamic_tile
"dynamic tile" instead.

A tile must be declared in the map data file with
<tt>tile{ ... }</tt>.

Additional properties:
- \c pattern (number): Id of the
  \ref quest_tileset_data_file_syntax_tile_patterns
  "tile pattern" to use.
- \c width (number): Width of the tile in pixels.
  It must be a multiple of the width of the pattern.
  The pattern will be repeated horizontally to fit this width.
- \c height (number): Height of the tile in pixels.
  It must be a multiple of the height of the pattern.
  The pattern will be repeated vertically to fit this height.

Example of tile:
\verbatim
tile{
  layer = 0,
  x = 1656,
  y = 104,
  width = 96,
  height = 16,
  pattern = 18,
}
\endverbatim

\subsubsection quest_map_data_file_syntax_dynamic_tile Dynamic tile

Dynamic tiles are like \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_tile "tiles",
except that they are not optimized at runtime.
Therefore, they can be enabled, disabled, created and deleted using the
\ref lua_api_dynamic_tile "Lua API".

A dynamic tile can be declared in the map data file with
<tt>dynamic_tile{ ... }</tt>.

Additional properties:
- \c pattern (number): Id of the
  \ref quest_tileset_data_file_syntax_tile_patterns
  "tile pattern" to use.
- \c width (number): Width of the tile in pixels.
  It must be a multiple of the width of the pattern.
  The pattern will be repeated horizontally to fit this width.
- \c height (number): Height of the tile in pixels.
  It must be a multiple of the height of the pattern.
  The pattern will be repeated vertically to fit this height.
- \c enabled_at_start (boolean): \c true to make the dynamic tile initially
  enabled, \c false to make it initially disabled.

Example of dynamic tile:
\verbatim
dynamic_tile{
  layer = 0,
  x = 552,
  y = 488,
  width = 48,
  height = 8,
  name = "bridge",
  pattern = 1030,
  enabled_at_start = false,
}
\endverbatim

- \c height (number): Height of the teletransporter in pixels.
- \c sprite (string, optional): Id of the animation set of a
  \ref quest_sprite_data_file "sprite" to create for the teletransporter.
  No value means no sprite (the teletransporter will then be invisible).
- \c sound (string, optional): Sound to play
  when the hero uses the
  teletransporter. No value means no sound.
- \c transition_style (number): Style of transition to play when the hero
  uses the teletransporter. \c 0: immediate (no transition), \c 1:
  fade-out effect, \c 2: scrolling between maps.
- \c destination_map (string): Id of the map to transport to (can be
  id of the current map).
- \c destination_name (string, optional): Location on the destination map.
  Can be the name of a \ref quest_map_data_file_syntax_destination
  "destination" entity,
  the special value \c "_same" to keep the hero's coordinates,
  or the special value \c "_side" to place on hero on the corresponding side
  of an adjacent map (normally used with the scrolling transition style).
  No value means the default destination entity of the map.

Example of teletransporter:
\verbatim
teletransporter{
  layer = 1,
  x = 112,
  y = 600,
  width = 16,

  when teletransporting the hero to this map without destination specified.
  No value means \c false.
  Only one destination can be the default one on a map.
  If no default destination is set, then the first one declared in set as
  the default one.

Example of destination:
\verbatim
destination{
  name = "from_outside",
  layer = 0,
  x = 160,
  y = 37,
  direction = 1,
  default = true,

  The sprite must have an animation \c "closed", that will be shown while
  the door is closed.
  When the door is open, no sprite is displayed.
  Optionally, the sprite can also have animations \c "opening"
  and \c "closing",
  that will be shown (if they exist) while the door is being opened or closed,
  respectively. If they don't exist, the door will open or close instantly.
- \c savegame_variable (string, optional): Name of the boolean value that
  stores in the savegame whether this door is open.
  No value means that the door is not saved.
  If the door is saved as open, then it appears open.
- \c opening_method (string, optional): How the door is supposed to be
  opened by the player. Must be one of:
  - \c "none" (default): Cannot be opened by the player. You can only open it
    from a Lua script.
  - \c "interaction": Can be opened by pressing the
    action command in front of the door.
  - \c "interaction_if_savegame_variable": Can be opened by pressing the
    action command in front of the door,
    provided that a specific savegame variable is set.
  - \c "interaction_if_item": Can be opened by pressing the
    action command in front of the door,
    provided that the player has a specific
    equipment item.

- \c opening_condition (string, optional): The condition required to open the
  door.
  Only for opening methods \c "interaction_if_savegame_variable" and
  \c "interaction_if_item".
  - For opening method \c "interaction_if_savegame_variable",
    it must be the name of a savegame variable.
    The hero
    will be allowed to open the door if this saved value is either
    \c true, an integer greater than zero or a non-empty string.
  - For opening method \c "interaction_if_item",
    it must be the id of an equipment item.
    The hero will be allowed to open the door if he has that item and,
    for items with an amount, if the amount is greater than zero.
  - For other opening methods, this setting has no effect.
- \c opening_condition_consumed (boolean, optional): Whether opening the
  door should consume the savegame variable or the
  equipment item that was required.
  The default setting is \c false.
  If you set it to \c true, the following rules are applied when the
  hero successfully opens the door:
  - For opening method \c "interaction_if_savegame_variable",
    the savegame variable that was required is reset to \c false,
    \c 0 or \c "" (depending on its type).
  - For opening method is \c "interaction_if_item", the equipment
    item that was required is removed. This means setting its
    possessed variant to \c 0, unless it has
    an associated amount: in this case, the amount is decremented.
  - With other opening methods, this setting has no effect.
- \c cannot_open_dialog_id (string, optional): Id of the dialog to show
  if the hero fails to open the door.
  If you don't set this value, no dialog is shown.
