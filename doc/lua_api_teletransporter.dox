\tableofcontents

A teletransporter is a detector that sends the
\ref lua_api_hero "hero" to another place when he walks on it.

This type of \ref lua_api_entity "map entity" can be declared in the
\ref lua_api_map_overview_files "map data file".
It can also be created dynamically with
\ref lua_api_map_create_teletransporter "map:create_teletransporter()".

\section lua_api_teletransporter_overview Overview

A teletransporter can send the \ref lua_api_hero "hero" to one of the
following kind of places.
- A \ref lua_api_destination "destination" entity, on the same \ref
  lua_api_map "map" or on another one.
- The same coordinates on another \ref lua_api_map "map".
- The side of an adjacent map (only possible for a teletransporter placed
  on a side of the current \ref lua_api_map "map").

Teletransporters can have any size,
but like all entities, their width and height
must be multiples of 8 pixels.
The minimum size if 16x16 pixels (the size of the hero).

\note You can also teletransport the \ref lua_api_hero "hero" explicitly
with \ref lua_api_hero_teleport "hero:teleport()".

\section lua_api_teletransporter_inherited_methods Methods inherited from map entity

Teletransporters are particular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_teletransporter_methods Methods of the type teletransporter

None.

\section lua_api_teletransporter_inherited_events Events inherited from map entity

Events are callback methods automatically called by the engine if you define
them.

Teletransporters are particular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all events from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_events to know these events.

\section lua_api_teletransporter_events Events of the type teletransporter

None.
