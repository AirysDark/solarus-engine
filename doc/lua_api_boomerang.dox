\tableofcontents

A boomerang \ref lua_api_entity "map entity"
is used to implement the
\ref lua_api_hero "hero"'s boomerang state.

This type of entity is entirely created and managed by the engine.
You cannot create or access a boomerang from Lua.

\section lua_api_boomerang_overview Overview

A boomerang entity is created when you call
\ref lua_api_hero_start_boomerang "hero:start_boomerang()".

It can immobilize or hurt
\ref lua_api_enemy "enemies" and activate mechanisms.

Note that
there is no predefined boomerang \ref lua_api_item "equipment item".
It is your responsability to make one if you want.
If you decide to make one, you will typically call
\ref lua_api_hero "hero:start_boomerang()" from
the \ref lua_api_item "item:on_using()" callback of
your boomerang equipment item.
