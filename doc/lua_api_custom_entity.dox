\page lua_api_custom_entity Custom entity

\tableofcontents

A custom entity is a map entity entirely defined by your Lua scripts.

This type of \ref lua_api_entity "map entity" can be declared in the
\ref lua_api_map_overview_files "map data file".
It can also be created dynamically with
\ref lua_api_map_create_custom_entity "map:create_custom_entity()".

\section lua_api_custom_entity_overview Overview

Custom entities have no special properties or behavior.
You can define them entirely in your scripts.

Optionally, a custom entity may be managed by a model.
The model is the name of a Lua script that will be applied to all custom
entities refering to it.
This works exactly like the
\ref lua_api_enemy_get_breed "breed" of enemies,
except that it is optional.
The model is useful if you have a lot of identical (or very similar)
custom entities in your game, like for example torches.

If you make an entity that is unique in your game, like for example,
a big rock that blocks the entrance of a dungeon and that requires some
special action from the player, you don't need a model.
You can just program define the behavior of your custom entity in the
script of the map where your entity is placed.

Similarly, to define a customized weapon of the hero, like a hammer,
you don't need a model.
Just create a custom entity from the item script of the hammer and define
its behavior there.

\section lua_api_custom_entity_inherited_methods Methods inherited from map entity

Custom entities are particular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_custom_entity_methods Methods of the type custom entity

The following methods are specific to custom entities.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_get_model custom_entity:get_model()

Returns the model of this custom entity.

The model is the name of a Lua script in the \c "entities" directory that
manages this custom entity.
This works exactly like the breed of
\ref lua_api_enemy "enemies",
except that it is optional.
- Return value (string): The model of custom entity, or \c nil if the custom
  entity has no model script.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_size custom_entity:set_size(width, height)

Sets the size of the
\ref lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box "bounding box"
of this custom entity.

The default value is \c 16x16 pixels.
This is the effective size used to detect obstacles when moving,
but the \ref lua_api_sprite "sprite(s)"
of the custom entity may be larger.
- \c width (number): Width of the custom entity in pixels.
- \c height (number): Height of the custom entity in pixels.

\remark If you create a
  \ref lua_api_custom_entity_add_collision_test
  "pixel-precise collision test",
  the test will use the sprit(e) of this custom entity,
  not its bounding box.
  Therefore, this function has no influence on pixel-precise collisions,
  only on the detection of obstacles of the map when the custom entity moves.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_origin custom_entity:set_origin(origin_x, origin_y)

Sets the origin point of this custom entity, relative to the upper left corner
of its
\ref lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box "bounding box".

This origin point property allows entities of different sizes to have
comparable reference points.
For example, if you need to compute an
\ref lua_api_entity_get_angle "angle" between two entities,
for example to move an entity away from another one,
the calculation uses the origin point of both entities.
Using the upper left corner of their bounding box would not give the correct
angle (unless both entities had the same size).

The origin point is also the point of synchronization of an entity with its
\ref lua_api_sprite "sprites" (because again, an entity that has a given
size may have sprites with different sizes).

The default values is <tt>8,13</tt> and is usually okay for custom entities of
size \c 16x16.
See \ref lua_api_entity_get_origin "entity:get_origin()" for more explanations
about the origin point.
- \c origin_x (number): X coordinate of the origin point in pixels,
  relative to the upper left corner of the custom entity's bounding box.
- \c origin_y (number): Y coordinate of the origin point in pixels,
  relative to the upper left corner of the custom entity's bounding box.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_get_direction custom_entity:get_direction()

Returns the direction of this custom entity.

This direction is set at creation time or when you can call
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_set_direction "custom_entity:set_direction()".
- Return value 1 (number): The direction.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_direction custom_entity:set_direction(direction)

Sets the direction of this custom entity.

Sprites of your custom entity has have such a direction automatically take it.
- Return value 1 (number): The direction.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_get_sprite custom_entity:get_sprite()

Returns the \ref lua_api_sprite "sprite" of this custom entity.
It may have been created at the creation of the custom entity,
or when you called
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_create_sprite "custom_entity:create_sprite()".
- Return value (\ref lua_api_sprite "sprite"): The first sprite created for
 this custom_entity.

\remark If the custom entity has several sprites, the first one created is returned.
  For the other sprites, you cannot use this function.
  However, it is easy to store the return values of your calls to
  \ref lua_api_custom_entity_create_sprite "custom_entity:create_sprite()".

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_create_sprite custom_entity:create_sprite(sprite_name)

Creates a \ref lua_api_sprite "sprite" for this custom entity.
- \c sprite_name (string): Name of the animation set of the
  sprite to create.
- Return value (\ref lua_api_sprite "sprite"): The sprite created.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_remove_sprite custom_entity:remove_sprite([sprite])

Removes and destroys a
\ref lua_api_sprite "sprite" of this custom_entity.

It may have been created at the creation of the custom entity,
or when you called
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_create_sprite "custom_entity:create_sprite()".
- \c sprite (\ref lua_api_sprite "sprite"): The sprite to remove.
  The default value is the first sprite that was created.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_is_drawn_in_y_order custom_entity:is_drawn_in_y_order()

Returns whether this custom entity is drawn in Y order.

The displaying order of entities having this
property depends on their Y position.
Entities without this property
are drawn in the normal order (i.e. in the order of their creation),
and before all entities with this property.

Entities with this property are displayed from the one the most to the
north to the one the most to the south.
- Return value (boolean): \c true if this custom entity is displayed in Y
  order, \c false if it is displayed in creation order.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_drawn_in_y_order custom_entity:set_drawn_in_y_order([y_order])

Sets whether this custom entity should be drawn in Y order.

The default setting is \c false, meaning that by default, a custom entity is
displayed in Z order, which is the creation order unless you call
\ref lua_api_entity_bring_to_front "entity:bring_to_front()"
or
\ref lua_api_entity_bring_to_back "entity:bring_to_back()".

See
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_is_drawn_in_y_order
"custom_entity:is_drawn_in_y_order()"
for more details.
- \c y_order (boolean, optional): \c true if this custom entity is displayed in Y
  order, \c false if it is displayed in creation order.
  No value means \c true.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_traversable_by custom_entity:set_traversable_by([entity_type], traversable)

Sets whether this custom entity can be traversed by other entities.

By default, a custom entity cannot be traversed.
- \c entity_type (string, optional): A type of entity.
  See \ref lua_api_entity_get_type "entity:get_type()" for the possible values.
  If not specified, the setting will be applied to all entity types that do
  not override it.
- \c traversable (boolean, function or \c nil): Whether this entity type can
  traverse your custom entity. This can be:
  - A boolean: \c true to make your custom entity traversable by this entity
    type, \c false to make it obstacle.
  - A function: Custom test.
    This allows you to decide dynamically.
    The function takes your custom entity
    and then the other entity as parameters, and should return \c true if you
    allow the other entity to traverse your custom entity.
    This function will be called every time a \ref lua_api_movement "moving"
    entity of the specified type is about to overlap your custom entity.
  - \c nil: Clears any previous setting for this entity type and therefore
    restores the default value.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_can_traverse custom_entity:set_can_traverse([entity_type], traversable)

Sets whether this custom entity can traverse other entities.

This is important only if your custom entity can
\ref lua_api_movement "move".

By default, this depends on the other entities: for example,
\ref lua_api_sensor "sensors" can be traversed by default
while \ref lua_api_door "doors" cannot unless they are open.
- \c entity_type (string, optional): A type of entity.
  See \ref lua_api_entity_get_type "entity:get_type()" for the possible values.
  If not specified, the setting will be applied to all entity types that do
  not override it.
- \c traversable (boolean, function or \c nil): Whether your custom entity can
  traverse the other entity type. This can be:
  - A boolean: \c true to allow your custom entity to traverse entities of the
    specified type, \c false otherwise.
  - A function: Custom test.
    This allows you to decide dynamically.
    The function takes your custom entity
    and then the other entity as parameters, and should return \c true if you
    allow your custom entity to traverse the other entity.
    When your custom entity has a \ref lua_api_movement "movement",
    this function will be called every time it is about to overlap an entity
    of the specified type.
  - \c nil: Clears any previous setting for this entity type and therefore
    restores the default value.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_can_traverse_ground custom_entity:can_traverse_ground(ground)

Returns whether this custom entity can traverse a kind of ground.

This is important only if your custom entity can
\ref lua_api_movement "move".

The \ref lua_api_map_get_ground "ground" is the terrain property of the
\ref lua_api_map "map".
It is defined by \ref lua_api_tile "tiles" and by other entities that may
change it dynamically.
- \c ground (string, optional): A kind of ground.
  See \ref lua_api_map_get_ground "map:get_ground()" for the possible values.
- Return value (boolean): \c true if your custom entity can traverse this
  kind of ground.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_can_traverse_ground custom_entity:set_can_traverse_ground(ground, traversable)

Sets whether this custom entity can traverse a kind of ground.

This is important only if your custom entity can
\ref lua_api_movement "move".

The \ref lua_api_map_get_ground "ground" is the terrain property of the
\ref lua_api_map "map".
It is defined by \ref lua_api_tile "tiles" and by other entities that may
change it dynamically.

By default, this depends on the the ground: for example,
the \c "grass" ground can be traversed by default
while the \c "low wall" ground cannot.
- \c ground (string, optional): A kind of ground.
  See \ref lua_api_map_get_ground "map:get_ground()" for the possible values.
- \c traversable (boolean): Whether your custom entity can
  traverse this kind of ground.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_add_collision_test custom_entity:add_collision_test(collision_test, callback)

Registers a function to be called when your custom entity detects a collision
when another entity.
- \c collision_test (string or function): Specifies what kind of collision you
  want to test. This may be one of:
  - \c "overlapping": Collision if the
    \ref lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box "bounding box"
    of both entities overlap.
    This is often used when the other entity can traverse your custom entity.
  - \c "containing": Collision if the bounding box of the other entity is
    fully inside the bounding box of your custom entity.
  - \c "origin": Collision if the \ref lua_api_entity_get_origin "origin point"
    or the other entity is inside the bounding box of your custom entity.
  - \c "center": Collision if the \ref lua_api_entity_get_center_position
    "center point" of the other entity is inside the bounding box of your
    custom entity.
  - \c "facing": Collision if the facing point of the other
    entity's bounding box is touching your custom entity's bounding box.
    Bounding boxes don't necessarily overlap, but they are in
    contact: there is no space between them.
    When you consider the bounding box of an entity,
    which is a rectangle with four sides,
    the facing point is the middle point of the side the entity is oriented to.
    This \c "facing" collision test is useful when the other entity cannot
    traverse your custom entity.
    For instance, if the other entity has direction "east", there is a
    collision if the middle of the east side of its bounding box touches
    (but does not necessarily overlap) your custom entity's bounding box.
    This is very often what you need, typically to let the hero interact with
    your entity when he is looking at it.
  - \c "touching": Like \c "facing", but accepts all four sides of the other
    entity's bounding box, no matter its direction.
  - \c "sprite": Collision if a sprite of the other entity overlaps a sprite of
    your custom entity.
    The collision test is pixel precise.
  - A function: Custom collision test. The function takes your custom entity
    and then the other entity as parameters and should return \c true if there
    is a collision between them.
    This function will be called every time the engine needs to check
    collisions between your custom entity and any other entity.
- \c callback (function): A function that will be called when the collision
  test detects a collision with another entity.
  This allows you to decide dynamically.
  This function takes your custom entity and then the other entity as
  parameters.
  If the collision test was \c "sprite", both involved sprites are also passed
  as third and fourth parameters: the third parameter is the sprite of your
  custom entity, and the fourth parameter is the sprite of the other entity.
  This may be useful when your entities have several sprites, otherwise you can
  just ignore these additional sprite parameters.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_clear_collision_tests custom_entity:clear_collision_tests()

Disables any collision test previously registered with
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_add_collision_test
"custom_entity:add_collision_test()".

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_has_layer_independent_collisions custom_entity:has_layer_independent_collisions()

Returns whether this custom entity can detect collisions with entities
even if they are not on the same layer.

By default, custom entities can only have collisions with entities on the
same layer.
- Return value (boolean): \c true if this entity can
  detect collisions even with entities on other layers.

\subsection lua_api_custom_entity_set_layer_independent_collisions custom_entity:set_layer_independent_collisions([independent])

Sets whether this custom entity can detect collisions with entities
even if they are not on the same layer.

By default, custom entities can only have collisions with entities on the
same layer.
If you set this property to \c true, the
\ref lua_api_custom_entity_add_collision_test "collision tests"
will be performed even with entities that are
on a different layer.
- \c independent (boolean, optional): \c true to make this entity detect
  collisions even
  with entities on other layers. No value means \c true.
