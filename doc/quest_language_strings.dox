/**
\page quest_language_strings Translated strings

Strings displayed during the game, for example in your menus,
need to be localized in the current language.
To this end, a \c strings.dat file is placed inside each
\c languages/xx/text directory, where \c xx is a language code
defined in
\ref quest_language_list_file "languages.dat"
(e.g. \c "en" or \c "fr").

When translating the game, you have to translate this \c strings.dat
file as well as the
\ref quest_language_dialogs "dialogs file" (\c dialogs.dat).
Have a look at the \ref translation page if you are interested in translating
the game (and you should also contact us).

\c string.dat is a text file encoded in UTF-8,
where each line has the following form:
\verbatim
key	some translation for this key
\endverbatim
Empty lines and lines beginning with \c '#' (comments) are ignored.

\c key is an ID of your choice that the user does not see.
Then there must be one or several tabulation characters (no space character
allowed here), and finally the translated string, possibly containing spaces.
Don't change the key when you are translating a quest, since the key
identifies the string.

I recommend to add comments (lines beginning by '#') to explain where each
string is used and how many characters it should not exceed.
Future translators will thank you.

An an example, here is a part of a possible \c languages/fr/text/strings.dat
file:
\verbatim
# Savegame selection menu.
# Strings beginning with "selection_menu.phase" should not exceed 45 characters.
selection_menu.phase.select_file	Veuillez choisir un fichier
selection_menu.phase.choose_mode	Choisissez un mode de jeu
selection_menu.phase.choose_name	Quel est votre nom ?
selection_menu.phase.confirm_erase	Etes-vous s√ªr ?
selection_menu.phase.erase_file		Quel fichier voulez-vous effacer ?
selection_menu.phase.options		Appuyez sur Espace pour modifier
selection_menu.phase.options.changing	<  > : choisir, Espace : valider
selection_menu.erase			Effacer
selection_menu.cancel			Annuler
selection_menu.big_yes			OUI
selection_menu.big_no			NON
selection_menu.empty			Vide
selection_menu.options			Options
selection_menu.back			Retour
selection_menu.options.language		Langue
selection_menu.options.video_mode	Mode
selection_menu.options.music_volume	Volume de la musique
selection_menu.options.sound_volume	Volume des sons
\endverbatim

The current version of the editor does not support edition of this
file \c string.dat yet. You have to edit it by hand.
