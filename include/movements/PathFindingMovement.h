/**
 * @brief Movement for an entity that looks for a path to another entity.
 *
 * This movement is typically used by enemies that try to reach the hero.
 * The entity tries to find a path and to avoid the obstacles on the way.
 * To this end, the PathFinding class (i.e. an implementation of the A* algorithm) is used.
 * If the target entity is too far or not reachable, the movement is a random walk.
