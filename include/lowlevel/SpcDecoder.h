/**
 * @brief Encapsulates the SPC music decoding.
 *
 * This class allows the Music class to be independent of the SPC library.
 * To decode SPC music files, the code of the Snes_SPC library is used.
 * Snes_SPC is a recent SPC decoding library that exists in two versions:
 * - a fast version, that renders music with a very nice quality;
 * - a highly accurate version, that renders music with a better accuracy, but about three times slower.
 * The source code of Solarus include the fast version of Snes_SPC, which I recommend
 * since the sound generated is good enough.
