/**
 * @brief Interface of a C++ type that can also exist as a Lua userdata.
 *
 * An optional reference counting system is provided.
 * It allows you to share safely the object between C++ and Lua,
 * no matter which world stops using it first.
 *
 * Lua bindings use the this system for all userdata created by Lua.
 * When the refcount gets to zero, it means that there is no more Lua userdata
 * for this object, and that C++ is not using the object either.
 * Therefore, you know you can delete the object.
 *
 * Note that if you don't need the refcount system, you don't have to use it.
 * You can just leave the refcount to zero and delete the object normally.
 * You don't need to care about refcounts if your object is not allocated
 * dynamically or if you don't share pointers.
 * If you export your object to Lua, refcounts will be very helpful.
