/**
 * @brief Some stairs that trigger a special animation on the hero.
 *
 * A stairs entity is a special terrain where the hero walks
 * either before going to another floor
 * or to change its layer inside a single floor.
 *
 * For stairs inside a single floor,
 * only one stairs entity has to be placed and the collisions will be detected on both layers.
 * This entity is usually placed on the low layer even if there is no obligation.
 *
 * For stairs that send the hero to another floor (i.e. another map),
 * there must be three entities:
 * - a teletransporter (that make the hero go to the next map),
 * - a stairs entity (that make the hero take the stairs animation),
 * - a destination point on the next map.
