solarus-1.0.0 (under development)

The "I love Lua" release.

This is a major release. The version number switches from 0.x to 1.x
because the scripting API is now complete and will remain more stable in the
future.
I now consider that Solarus can be used to create your own Zelda-like
games in decent conditions.
By "in decent conditions", I essentially mean: with a clean and stable
scripting API. Clean because there are nice datatypes now and the API is much
easier to use, less error-prone and more with the Lua spirit.
Stable because future versions of the scripting API will now try to keep
compatibility with existing scripts. Any API change that breaks compatibility
will now be clearly documented and conversion scripts will be provided.

Data files and scripts written for solarus 0.x are not compatible with
solarus 1.x.
Which is not a problem since until now, I never said you could create a quest
in decent conditions :)
More seriously, I guess I'm the only one to have a lot of data files and
scripts created for solarus 0.x.
Anyway, conversion scripts are provided to upgrade existing data files,
but not for scripts (the scripting API, which was working but ugly and
unstable, has totally changed).

Changes:

* Rewrite the Lua scripting API from scratch. Cleaner, real datatypes, much
easier to use, less error-prone.
* Add support of scripted menus. They are no longer hardcoded into the engine.
* Data files are also in Lua now (no more ini files or custom text files).
* Add conversion scripts to upgrade existing data files (but not scripts).
